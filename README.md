# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is destined to store algorithms and data structures that I will be using to improve my coding skills.

The following topics **must** me fulfilled until the end of my undergraduate course in Computer Science:

## ALGORITHMS
- [x] Searching
- [x] Sorting
- [x] Recursion
- [ ] Greedy Algorithm
- [ ] Dynamic Programming 
- [ ] Backtracking
- [ ] Math
- [ ] Bitwise operations/algo
- [ ] Geometric algorithms
- [ ] Pattern searching

## DATA STRUCTURES
- [x] Arrays
- [x] Matrix
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] BST
- [x] Heap (min and max)
- [ ] Hashing
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue 

## This is a list of my current technical skills, as well as my proficiency in such technologies:

* Python (beginner)
* C++ (beginner)
* MySQL (intermediate)
* Linux (beginner)


Moreover, all of these questions must be solved: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/
